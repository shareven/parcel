This is a free, open-source, ad-free, offline app that prioritizes simplicity and does not collect any personal information.

This app automatically parses received SMS messages and extracts the address and pickup code information, which can be displayed on a desktop card (dark mode supported).

You can add custom rules to improve the parsing effect.

Supports Taobao and Pinduoduo ID codes.

It also supports listening to third-party app notifications and automatically saving pickup code messages, making it more convenient for WeChat friends to pick up their packages.

Enabling notification listening permissions also allows for background process persistence and real-time updates to the desktop card.

Adding a desktop card: Generally hidden in the "All Cards" section at the bottom, under "Plugins" or "Android Widgets".
